In a team of 4, we designed a gearbox for a glass fiber recycling system to meet the needs of a design team from McGill University.
 The gearbox translates a maximum input power of 65 HP at 12000 rpm to two output shafts: the first powers a grinder and sieve shaker which together require 60 HP at 10500 rpm, and the second powers a ventilation fan with 5 HP at 8000 rpm.
 The gearbox consists of one input shaft and two output shafts.
