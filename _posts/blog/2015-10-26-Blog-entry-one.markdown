As an engineering student, you probably know by now that engineering is all about problem solving. Our degree teaches us just that; it forges our minds to be able to approach problems in a specific way and find solutions. What exactly is problem solving? It isn't just being able to solve ordinary differential equations or a thermodynamics problem. It's more than a skill, <strong>it's a mindset</strong>. By understanding the value of problem solving in our life, we can learn to appreciate the strength of what we do.

The process of problem solving can be broken into three essential steps. Different areas of the brain are involved in each step. The <strong>striatum</strong>, which is part of the basal ganglia, the inner core of the brain, has three sections which are each involved in a different part of the process of solving a problem.

The first step in problem solving is to recognize the problem and analyze it. One part of the striatum is responsible for the organization of your thoughts when you're assessing the problem. This is where you're gathering and isolating facts, determining the origin of the problem, the cause, etc.

Another part of the striatum is responsible for proposing solutions to the problem and evaluating them. This is where you're drawing from your past experiences and knowledge to come up with potential solutions. You're then analyzing the benefits and negative consequences of each solution, along with the risks of each action taken.

Finally, the last part of the striatum implements the solution. It controls all of the actions taken to prepare for the solution.

Training your ability to solve problems works your mind to be <strong>proactive</strong>. You're taking on an active role to every situation that you encounter. Problem solving is a mindset; you're built to understand every situation and to react accordingly.

You observe problems and analyze them. You learn how to recognize patterns in everyday things that occur as well as large scale events. You develop a mental map and strategy to approach the problem. As a result, you have the foresight to predict, prevent and plan for every situation accordingly.

Having a proactive mindset enables you to have <strong>control</strong> of every situation. Your performance improves, because you're reacting based on your assessment of the circumstances. Problem solving eventually becomes a habit, and you subconsciously approach every situation in a more effective way.

My definition of higher-level thinking is being able to look down at yourself from an objective perspective in order to evaluate your circumstances.

You use a higher-level thinking to evaluate your actions and the results of these actions. Humans tend to use their emotions to evaluate their actions. Problem solving enables you to make your assessments objectively. You're evaluating your actions based on whether or not the results of your actions align with your goals.

Higher-level thinking combined with your problem solving habits is a powerful tool for self improvement. You learn to make decisions effectively. You're able to identify aspects to change or to improve in yourself and in your actions. You are trained to determine the changes needed to reach your goals.
